A place to collect and distill ideas for community improvements to the Railcore 2 3d printer.

Please feel free to enter issues with design improvements you'd like to make.

At this time, we're still trying to figure out the scope of this effort and how big of a mod package we want to build.  To that end, let's try to focus the initial issue reports more on the problems we're trying to solve and less on proposing solutions.  By all means, propose solutions, but let's also make sure we really understand everyone's problem space while we're at this.
